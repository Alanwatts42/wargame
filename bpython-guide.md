Features:
Try using undo `(C-r)`!
Edit the current line `(C-x)` or the entire session `(F7)` 
in an external editor. (currently vi)-s) or post them to 
pastebins `(F8)`! Current pastebin helper: reload all 
modules and rerun session `(F6)` to test out changes to a 
module. Toggle auto-reload mode `(F5)` to re-execute the 
current session when a module you've imported is modified.

A config file at `~/.config/bpython/config` customizes keys 
and behavior of bpython.
You can also set which pastebin helper and which external 
editor to use.
See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bpython/bpython/master/bpython/sample-config for an example config file.
